description: A debutante hailing from an aristocratic family in the Northeastern United
  States, Beatrice Lansell fills her days with coquetry, leisure and meaningless flirtations,
  but she has never found true love. Her family is pressing her to accept the marriage
  offer of a wealthy Englishman, but the staunchly independent Beatrice finds herself
  equally annoyed and attracted by mysterious cowboy Keith Cameron. Will this improbable
  romance last?
